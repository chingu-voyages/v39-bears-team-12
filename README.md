# Manual testing app

The goal of this app is to make user life easier while testing their own apps. It is used to create the testing workflow, record tests, and see final results.

## Installing project

First clone this repository to your local machine using the command `git clone https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v39-bears-team-12.git`

Then open the folder in VS Code or terminal and install dependencies in the root, frontend, and backend folders with `npm install` in the root. To install in the frontend part change the directory to that folder and then install `cd frontend` and then `npm install`. To return to the root folder you can simply write `cd ..` in the terminal. Lastly, install dependencies for the backend too, steps are the same as for the frontend.
